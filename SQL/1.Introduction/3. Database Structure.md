- An Database System is very structured , and it starts with initially a Physical hardware called ==Server== where the database lives .
- Inside a Server , we can have multiple ==Databases== which are a container for data.
- In Each Data Base we can have multiple ==Schemas== . Schemas are an logical or imaginary container where we can group the tables that are created accordingly.
	- For Example, Under a Schema called Orders - We can put all the tables related to customer orders . Under another Schema called Customers - We can put all the tables related to customer details.
- Inside Schema , we can have multiple objects known as ==Tables== 
	- Tables are nothing but a spreadsheet which has ==Rows== and ==Columns== with a #Primary_Key and it organizes the data based on ==Columns==. So that each column is about one type of data 
	- Columns are also called as ==Fields== ; Rows are also called as ==Records==.
	- Rows are where actually a data is stored , each row is contains data about a specific person , objects etc.,

#Primary_Key:
- This is a very important column of Values , It is a ==Unique Identifier== for each row . Using this only we can join 2 tables , for identifying quickly a needed data etc.,
- There are no 2 Rows having same Primary Key value

Each Cell or Value Stores a specific types of Data :
1. **Numeric Data Type :**
	- ==INT== --> 1 2 3 ...
	- ==DECIMAL== --> 3.14 , 100.50 ...

2. **String Data Types :**
	- ==CHAR== --> Strings or letters that cannot be changed once initialized . A Fixed Character
	- ==VARCHAR== --> Strings or letters that can be changed anytime we need . A Variable Character

3. **Date & Time Data Types :**
	- ==DATE== --> 2025-10-30
	- ==TIME== --> 09:30:00

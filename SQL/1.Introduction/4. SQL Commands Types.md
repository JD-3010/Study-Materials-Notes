Lets say we have a database and it is empty ,so now we need to create a Tables in order to input the data's . 

So We'll use ==CREATE== Command to create a new table inside the database which will have the column details but wont have any actual data inside the records or rows . Here we have defined something new.

- These Type of Commands are called ==Data Definition Language== aka. ==**DDL**==.. Commands Like : 
	- **CREATE** - To Create a table , 
	- **ALTER** - To Alter the structure of a existing table , 
	- **DROP** - To Delete the Table

Now if we look at the table it is empty it doesn't have any records or data , lets say a application is getting a stream of data from a college all these data should be entering into the tables into the database. Here we will be using command like ==INSERT==.

- These Type of Commands are called ==Data Manipulation Language== aka ==**DML**==. . Commands like :
	- **INSERT** - To enter or insert data in the rows or fields of a table 
	- **UPDATE** - To update a value that is already in a row or field
	- **DELETE** - To delete a specific Value in a row or field

==NOTE : ==
**DROP** - Deletes the entire table at once , it deletes in structural level of the table 
**DELETE** - Deletes only the value we explicitly specific , it doesn't delete the structure of the Table 

Now we have a table and we have values inside the table as well . But how to retrieve or get a data when needed . Here we will be using the command ==SELECT==. Using this we can talk to the database and retrieve the data that is stored inside the database.

- These Type of Commands are called ==Data Query Language== aka ==**DQL**== . Command Like :
	- **SELECT** - To send a query or question and get the answer or retrieve a data from the database.

==What is SQL ?==
In current life , everything is data from our phone number to bank pin and information etc etc. But where are these data are getting stored.

We can store these data in excel files, pdfs , text files etc etc . But larger Organization use a very large amount of data such as sales information , customer data and many more , these companies can store their data in small files which is unreliable on a large scale .

Here is where Database comes in act , #Database is nothing but a container for storing data which is organized and structured which makes it easy to access and retrieve and search a data.

Now how do you talk to a #Database to retrieve a data or search a data , That is where we use a language called #SQL . Why we use #SQL because they can handle huge amount of data like #Big_Data and storing in a Database is also secure

== #SQL - Structured Query Language ==

==What is DBMS & SQL Server==

There are many ways a company can communicate with Database , Either Directly or through an application or for some process through codes or tools like Python or Power BI for data visualization etc.

But the Database is just a container or a storage , but we need something to manage all the queries and requests sent by different sources . That is were ==DBMS - Database Management System== comes into picture.

DBMS is a software that can manage all the queries and requests coming to the database and prioritize which request should be completed first . 

Now we can store and manage these large amounts of Data as these data should be monitored 24/7 as Hardware level , since even a slight issue can make the data corrupted . Hence these Database and DBMS systems are either stored in a Server and are accessible through Cloud 

==Key Points==

- Database - Stores Data
- SQL - Language for speaking to the Data / Database
- DBMS - Manages the Database
- Server - Physical hardware / Machines where the Database Lives
